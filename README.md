# MobWeb_UpdateStockStatus extension for Magento

A simple Magento extension that checks a simple product's stock quantity upon saving and updates its stock status. If the simple product
belongs to a parent configurable product, the extension also checks the stock quantities of the other associated simple products, and updates
the stock status of the parent configurable product accordingly.

## Installation

## Questions? Need help?

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible.
