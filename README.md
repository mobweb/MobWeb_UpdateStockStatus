A simple Magento extension that automatically sets a product's `Is in Stock` attribute to `true` if the product's stock is greater than 0. Also does the same for a configurable parent product, if one exists.

## Questions? Need help?

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible. If you have a question or are confused about how something is supposed to work, feel free to get in touch and I'll try and help: [info@mobweb.ch](mailto:info@mobweb.ch).
